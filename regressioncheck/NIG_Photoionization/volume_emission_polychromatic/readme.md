# Photoionization: Volumetric Emission Polychromatic
* Particle emission due to photoionization of $`H_{2}`$ in a volume only (no surface emission)
* no deposition, no interpolation 
* comparison of the number of emitted electrons with a reference solution
* different MPF and number of MPI ranks are tested to yield the same result
* Note: Because the volume is exactly 1 cubic metre, the calculated electron density is exactly the number of real electrons in the system
