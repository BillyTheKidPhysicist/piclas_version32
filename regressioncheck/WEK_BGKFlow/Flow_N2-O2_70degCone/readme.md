# BGK-Flow - Hypersonic flow around a 70° Cone (Axisymmetric)
* Simulation of a hypersonic N2/O2 flow around a 70° blunted cone at M = 20
* Test case based on Allègre, J., Bisch, D., & Lengrand, J. C. (1997). Experimental Rarefied Heat Transfer at Hypersonic Conditions over 70-Degree Blunted Cone. Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 34(6), 724–728. https://doi.org/10.2514/2.3302
* Comparison of the heat flux with a reference surface state file (produced with DSMC)
