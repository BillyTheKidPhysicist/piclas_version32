# 1D turner setup and bias voltage feature
- He plasma between two electrodes one of which is usually AC, but for this bias-voltage test case it is set to DC starting at 0V
- bias voltage for DC only (field BCType=50)
- ion excess on both electrodes generates a positive bias voltage and electron excess a negative potential
- comparison of PartAnalyze.csv with reference file and integration of the bias voltage over time from SurfaceAnalyze.csv
