# vMPF: Channel flow with particle merge
* Channel flow with a sudden volume change (mortar interface) and particle merge to 500 particles
* Number density should remain constant across interface
* New particle weights after merge cannot distributed evenly as density distribution due to flow across cell has to be reproduced
