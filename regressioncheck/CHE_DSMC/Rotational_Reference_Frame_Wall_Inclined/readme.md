# Rotational frame of reference: Wall interaction
* Frame of reference is rotating with a single revolution per second
* A single particle is inserted at (x,y) = (0.25,-0.25) and is expected to "move" on a circular path in the rotating frame of reference due to the fictitious forces
* A wall is rotating with the frame of reference, after a collision, the particle should remain stationary in the rotating frame of reference at (x,y) = (0.25,0.25)
* Test is stopped afterwards, as machine precision can lead to loss of the particle as it remains directly on the cell boundary
