# parallel plate testcase
* 5000 Ar+ ions are accelerated against the right electrode where secondary electron emission (SEE-I) is performed
* SEE model from D. Depla "Magnetron sputter deposition: Linking discharge voltage with target properties", 2009
    * various metal surfaces with different yields
    * the SEE-I model yields an emission ratio of 13 % (hence 650 electrons should be created in this setup)
* Coupled Power
    * output is compared with a reference value that has been tuned to give ~ 1 J
    * parameter.ini for activating coupled Power output

              CalcCoupledPower = T
