# BGK Reservoir - Relaxation of a Ar-He mixture
* Test the relaxation of a mixture from thermal non-equilibrium with ESBGK (CollModel=1)
* Restart from a given state file
* Equal parts of Argon and Helium at different initial temperatures, T_Ar = 10000K and T_He=1000K
* Comparison with DSMC is shown in Figure_Comparison_DSMC.png (dashed line: ESBGK, T_s)
