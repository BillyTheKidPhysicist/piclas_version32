# Vibrational rates through cross-section data
* Multi-species background gas with a CO2-N2-He reservoir using cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Testing the calculation of the pair specific vibrational relaxation probability from cross-sectional data
* Adapting the constant velocity of the electrons from 0.01 eV to 100 eV
* Relaxation probability compared with the theoretical results (see Figure)
* "get_values.py" script can be utilized to collect the probability from the reference databases
