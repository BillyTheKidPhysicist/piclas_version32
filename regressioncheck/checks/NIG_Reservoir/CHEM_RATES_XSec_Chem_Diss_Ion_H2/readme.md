# XSec Chemistry: Ionization (H2 + e -> H2Ion1 + e + e) and Dissociative Ionization, H2 + e -> H + e + e + HIon1
* Test the reaction rates using cross-section based chemistry
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.png shows the comparison with the theoretical rate
