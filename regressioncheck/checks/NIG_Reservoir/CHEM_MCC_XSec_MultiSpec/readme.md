# Multi-species background gas with MCC and QK ionization
* Testing the multi-species background gas with a CO2-N2-He reservoir
* Ionization using QK chemistry through electron-impact using effective cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Background gas: 3E23 1/m3 (1/3 each)
* n_e = 1E19 1/m3, T_e = 150000K
* Expected result: CO2 ionizes the most due to the lowest energy threshold, followed by N2
