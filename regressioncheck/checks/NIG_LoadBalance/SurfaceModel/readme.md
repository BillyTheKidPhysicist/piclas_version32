# Loadbalance and initial-autorestart in combination with different surfacemodels (0,2,3)
Explanation
    * A flow around an ESA-p-Probe
    * O and O2 flow at Ma=1.5 and Kn=0.01
    * catalytic reactions at surface
    * adpative outflow boundary
Tests
    * Automatic load balance with element times and Partweight
    * Automatic initial restart with element times
    * restart for adaptive boundaries and surfacemodel containers
