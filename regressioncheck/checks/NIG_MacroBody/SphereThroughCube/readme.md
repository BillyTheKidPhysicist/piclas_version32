# Macro sphere tracking test
* 2 Macro sphere move through different reservoirs
  *  one macrosphere with perfect reflective surface
  *  one macrosphere with diffuse reflective surface
* 4 meshes are used
  *  2 Bilinear with 10x10x10 and 1x1x1
  *  2 Planar 10x10x10 and 1x1x1
  *  2 Boundaries: 1 open an 5 reflective
* Inserted DSMC particles have 0 velocity at beginning

* Tests wether particles move out of reservoir or inside of spheres during tracking
