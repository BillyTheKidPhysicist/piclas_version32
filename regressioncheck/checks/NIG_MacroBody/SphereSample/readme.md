# Macro sphere sampling analyze
*  Macro sphere fixed in channel
*  2 meshes with Bilinear and planar sides are used
    *  10x3x3 and 10x1x1 and sampling data is compared to reference files
*  Additionally DSMC particles are inserted and tracked

*  Tests:
    *  DSMC macro write out because of MacroSphere volumereduction
    *  Volume portions are calculated corrrectly?
    *  Particles are tracked without moving out of channel or inside of spheres
