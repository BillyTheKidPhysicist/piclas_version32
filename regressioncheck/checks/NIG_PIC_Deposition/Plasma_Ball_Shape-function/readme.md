# plasma ball example
* A ball of particles with, each with charge=1.60217653E-5 is initialized and deposited on the grid
    in order to check the deposition method "shape_function" in different
    directions via

    PIC-shapefunction-direction = 1,2,3

    and depositing the charge one- and two-dimensionally via

    PIC-shapefunction-dimension = 1,2
