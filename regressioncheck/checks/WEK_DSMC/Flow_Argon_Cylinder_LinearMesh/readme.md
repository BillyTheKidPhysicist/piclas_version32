# DSMC - Hypersonic flow around a cylinder (2D)
* Simulation of a hypersonic Argon flow around a cylinder at a Knudsen number of 0.25
* Test case based on Lofthouse, A. J., Boyd, I. D., & Wright, M. J. (2007). Effects of continuum breakdown on hypersonic aerothermodynamics. Physics of Fluids, 19(2). https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2710289
* 2D simulation: Linear mesh with surface flux particle emission
