# 2D shape function deposition and inner BCs (=100)
Tests
    * combined shape function deposition and cell local (near boundaries, where the shape function
        would be truncated)
    * particle removal in dielectric regions during initial emission
    * inner BC (100) which are treated as normal inner faces in the HDG solver
