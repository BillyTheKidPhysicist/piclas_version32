# PIC (Poisson) Discharge
* RF discharge between two electrodes with Helium
    * Ionization of background gas
* Secondary electron emission at x-direction boundaries (species 2 has mass of electrons, but
    positive charge)
    * Emission model: SEE-I (bombarding electrons are removed, Argon ions on different materials is considered for secondary e- emission with 0.13 probability) by Depla2009
