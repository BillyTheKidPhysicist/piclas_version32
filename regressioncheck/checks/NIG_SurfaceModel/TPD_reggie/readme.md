# SurfacModel=3 and temperature programmed desorption
Explanation
    * Emission disabled
    * Surface temperature is increase from 100 to 1000 K accoridng to temperature slope
    * Chemical reactions and desorption takes place in two temperature regions
    * Analyze of the two desorption regions and comparison with reference
Tests
    * Physically correct calculation of chemical rates for surfacemodel 3
    * analyze output for number of desorbing particles
