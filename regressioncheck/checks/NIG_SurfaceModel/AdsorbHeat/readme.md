# SurfacModel=3 calculation of adsorption heat and activation barriers
Explanation
    * Emission is disabled
    * 13 different species
    * Different adsorption site and with different mechanics for each species
    * Activation barriers for all reactions are calculated and written into SurfaceAnalyze.csv
Tests
    * calculation of activation barriers
