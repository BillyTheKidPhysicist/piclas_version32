# 2D: Particle Emission through Surface Flux (Channel/Cylinder)
* Testing the surface flux emission routine for 2D and axisymmetric (radial weighting=T/F)
* Comparison of PartAnalyze: particle number and temperature
* Desired result of DSMC output: constant number density of at n=1E21 across the first cell row starting at X=0 and all temperatures at T=5000K
* Comparison of DSMCState not possible due to strong fluctuations
