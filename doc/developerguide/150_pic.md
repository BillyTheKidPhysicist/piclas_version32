This chapter contains information regarding the implemented PIC methods.

## Deposition

Charge and current deposition can be performed using different methods, among others, shape
functions, B-splines or locally volume-weighted.

### Shape Function

High-order field solvers require deposition methods that reduce the noise, e.g., shape functions [@Jacobs2006].
The following polynomial isotropic shape functions are all designed to be used in three dimensions, where reductions to 2D and 1D are applied.

#### Shape Function 1D {-} 
A one-dimensional shape function in $x$-direction is given by

\begin{equation}
S_{1D}(r,R,\alpha)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+3/2)}{\sqrt{\pi}R\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Delta y \Delta z}\left( 1-\left( \frac{r}{R} \right)^{2} \right)^{\alpha}~,
\end{equation}

which is normalized to give $\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}\int_{y_{1}}^{y_{2}}\int_{-R}^{R}S_{1D}(r,R,\alpha)dxdydz=1$,
where the radius ${r=|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{n}|=|x-x_{n}|}$ is the distance between the position of the 
grid point at position $\boldsymbol{x}$ and the $n$-th particle at position $\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$, 
$R$ is the cut-off radius, $\Delta y=y_{2}-y_{1}$ and $\Delta z=z_{2}-z_{1}$ are the domain lengths in $y$- and $z$-direction,
respectively, and $\Gamma(z)$ is the gamma function given by

\begin{equation}
  \Gamma(z)=\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{z-1}\exp(-x)dx~.
\end{equation}


#### Shape Function 2D {-} 
A two-dimensional shape function in $x$-$y$-direction is given by

\begin{equation}
S_{2D}(r,R,\alpha)=\frac{\alpha+1}{\pi R^{2} \Delta z}\left( 1-\left( \frac{r}{R} \right)^{2} \right)^{\alpha}~,
\end{equation}

which is normalized to give $\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{R}S_{2D}(r,R,\alpha)rdr d\phi d\theta=1$,
where the radius ${r=|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{n}|}$ is the distance between the position of the 
grid point at position $\boldsymbol{x}$ and the $n$-th particle at position $\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$, 
$R$ is the cut-off radius and $\Delta z=z_{2}-z_{1}$ is the domain length in $z$-direction.


#### Shape Function 3D {-} 
A three-dimensional shape function in $x$-$y$-direction is given by [@Stock2012]

\begin{equation}
S_{3D}(r,R,\alpha)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+5/2)}{\pi^{3/2}R^{3}\Gamma(\alpha+1)}\left( 1-\left( \frac{r}{R} \right)^{2} \right)^{\alpha}~,
\end{equation}

which is normalized to give $\int_{0}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{R}S_{2D}(r,R,\alpha)r^{2}\sin(\phi)dr d\phi d\theta=1$,
where the radius ${r=|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{n}|}$ is the distance between the position of the 
grid point at position $\boldsymbol{x}$ and the $n$-th particle at position $\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$ and 
$R$ is the cut-off radius.
