# MPI Implementation \label{chap:mpi}

how to parallelize routines


## Things to consider \label{chap:mpi_consider}
In case any new communicator (e.g. SurfCOMM%COMM) is built during init or anywhere else with `CALL MPI_COMM_SPLIT(NEWCOMMUNICATOR,iERROR)` or such, it is necessary to finalize it with `CALL MPI_COMM_FREE(NEWCOMMUNICATOR,iERROR)`.

Else Loadbalances produce undefined errors that are almost impossible to find.
