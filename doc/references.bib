The simulation of unbounded domains inevitably requires an artificial truncation of the computational domain and spurious reflections resulting from this procedure are a common problem. In this paper, a perfectly matched layer formulation for Maxwell's equations in purely hyperbolic form is presented. The model is applied to standard wave attenuation problems and particle-in-cell simulations of electron beam devices.},

@article{Farbar2014,
abstract = {The performance of different types of boundary conditions used in direct simulation Monte Carlo models of subsonic flows for single species flow fields is assessed in this study. An inlet boundary condition that permits the specification of pressure and temperature is investigated, as well as one that permits the specification of mass flow rate and temperature. A new inlet boundary condition is suggested that permits the total mass flow rate to be specified without requiring inter-processor communication during a parallel computation. Two types of outlet boundary conditions are investigated, one in which the outlet pressure is maintained by controlling the porosity of the outlet surface, and another in which particles are introduced at the outlet with properties such that the desired pressure is maintained. Each of the boundary conditions investigated produce flow field results for a single species, microchannel flow that are in good agreement with an analytical solution of the flow field and previously reported results. However, a simulation of a more complicated multi-species flow inside a vapor deposition reactor shows that some of the predicted flow field and surface properties are a function of the type of outlet boundary condition used. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lei2017,
abstract = {New treatments of the subsonic constant flow rate boundary and porous outlet boundary used for the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are proposed. For the constant flow rate boundary, the total number of molecules inserted is calculated using the number of molecules that flow out of the boundary at previous time step, and the molecules inserted over the boundary are distributed according to the local mean flow velocity and number density. For the porous outlet, it is used to simulate the vacuum pump, and the deleting probability is calculated using the number of molecules that impinge on the boundary, the local pressure and the pump speed. Except for the constant flow inlet and porous outlet, the pressure inlet/outlet and the outgassing wall boundaries are implemented in dsmcFoam and verified. The results of different treatments of the boundary are compared with each other, it shows that the new treatment of the constant flow rate boundary can achieve a more accurate flow rate, and the non-uniform distribution of the inserted molecules can decrease the averaging effect at the inlet; the porous outlet can achieve the desired pressure at the outlet when just giving the pump speed, but there is an averaging effect compared with the pressure outlet due to the uniform deleting probability. The results are also compared with that of DS2V when the boundary conditions are available, it shows that the constant pressure boundary can achieve a more accurate pressure in dsmcFoam than in DS2V, and the results of the outgassing wall are almost the same with both solvers.},

abstract = {The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model as well as its extensions (ellipsoidal statistical BGK, Shakhov BGK, unified BGK) are used in particle-based fluid dynamics and compared with the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method (DSMC). To this end, a method based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is presented that allows efficient sampling of the Shakhov and the unified target distribution functions. As a consequence, particle simulations based on the Shakhov BGK and the unified BGK model are possible in an efficient way. The models are validated with a Couette flow problem at different Knudsen numbers and wall velocities. Furthermore, the models are compared with DSMC results of a hypersonic flow around a 70{\$}{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$} blunted cone. It is shown that the unified BGK model is able to reproduce rarefied gas phenomena and the Shakhov model performs better in the reproduction of shock structures compared with the ellipsoidal statistical BGK model. Additionally, a computational time study is done to show the efficiency of BGK-based simulations for low Knudsen number flows compared with DSMC. This is especially interesting for gas flows which cover a wide range of Knudsen numbers including continuum and rarefied gas regions as in nozzle expansion flows. The fact that DSMC and the utilized BGK methods are both cell local Monte-Carlo based particle methods, makes a coupling very attractive.},
