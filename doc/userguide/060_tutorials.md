# Tutorials \label{chap:tutorials}

This chapter will give a detailed overview of simulations with **PICLas**. It assumes that you are familiar with how to set the compiler options and how to compile the code. The paths to the executables are omitted. It is assumed that you either added aliases for **piclas**, **hopr** and **piclas2vtk**, or that you added the binary directories to your `$PATH` variable as described in \ref{sec:installation_directory}. 

Each tutorial is equipped with .ini files *parameter_hopr.ini*, *parameter_piclas.ini*, *parameter_posti.ini* (possibly *DSMCSpecies.ini*) as well as the mesh file *\*\_mesh.h5* in the HDF5 format (created with **HOPR**).

~~~~~~
parameter_hopr.ini
parameter_piclas.ini
DSMCSpecies.ini
parameter_posti.ini
mesh.h5

We suggest to copy each folder to a new directory, where you can run and modify the parameter files.
